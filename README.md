# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis
This repository contains a project demonstrating the use of Multiple Linear Regression to analyze and predict the profitability of startups based on various factors. The analysis is conducted using Python, with the dataset provided in this repository.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the relationships between key factors (such as R&D Spend, Administration costs, and Marketing Spend) and the profitability of startups. By employing multiple linear regression, we aim to:
Identify the significant predictors of profit.
Develop a predictive model to estimate profitability.
Repository Structure
harshkumarsharma_multiple_linear_regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and analysis.
Successful_Startups.csv: Dataset used for the analysis.

Dataset Description
The dataset Successful_Startups.csv includes the following columns:
R&D Spend: Amount spent on research and development.
Administration: Costs associated with administrative functions.
Marketing Spend: Expenditure on marketing activities.
Season: Seasonal factor influencing the startup.
Profit: Profit earned by the startup (target variable).

Key Features
Data Exploration: Visualizations and summary statistics to understand the dataset.
Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Model Building: Implementation of multiple linear regression to predict the target variable.
Evaluation: Metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are used to evaluate model performance.
